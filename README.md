# VoxelCraft
A 16x16 clone of Minecraft Classic, written in Python with the Ursina Engine

Features:Trees, Water(But there's no gravity, so if you break a block next to water, expect to see some floating water), Random Terrain Generation(with Perlin Noise), Inventory(With 4 items:Grass, Stone, Copper and Diamond) and Shaders(with the prefabricated lit_with_shadows_shader of Ursina)
   
Yet to be implemented: Infinite worlds, Caves, Multiplayer and Crafting(Perhaps in the very distant future?)
